## Description
### Login - SignUp
- We do account creation and login using Firebase.
### There are 4 sections in TabBar.
- First section
  - There 2 collection view on top and bottom. Different recipes are listed in two collectionviews. You can tap on the recipe you like and go to the detail page. When you go to the detail page, you can add the recipe to "Favorites" for later use.
  
- Second section
  - Here again different recipes are listed. Unlike the first screen, we can use the "Search" feature on this page to more easily access recipes with the content we want. Also from this page, we can reach the detail page and add it to "Favorite".
  
- Third section
  - I thought of the idea for this page myself. A solution I found for those who have trouble choosing food. On this screen, we are greeted by 3 random recipes. If you don't like the food you see, you can list 3 different recipes by pressing the "Shuffle" button.
  
- Last section
  - All the recipes you have added to favorites are listed here. You can add or remove from favorites at any time.
